# Beginner Python Projects 

A hands-on collection of **8 beginner-friendly Python scripts** to practice core programming concepts.  
Each project is self-contained in a single `.py` file — short, easy to run, and intended to teach one idea (I/O, loops, randomness, functions, lists). These are great for learners who want practical exercises or small portfolio pieces.

##  Projects 

1. ➗ `math_tutor.py` — Multiplication and arithmetic practice (supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) with a timed score and results summary.  
   **What I learned:** using `random` and `time`, generating integer-safe division questions, and collecting detailed result summaries.

2. ☕ `loyalty_points.py` — Loyalty points engine that converts purchases to points and maps totals to Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers.  
   **What I learned:** writing small reusable functions and implementing business logic for tiering.

3. 🟢 `marble_trading.py` — Simple marble betting game with purse tracking, variable outcomes, and risk management.  
   **What I learned:** randomness for game behavior, state tracking (purse), and input validation for bets.

4. 🎯 `guess_game.py` — Number guessing game with close/far hints and limited attempts.  
   **What I learned:** user input validation, loop control, and improving user experience with helpful feedback.

5. 📱 `phone_formatter.py` — Clean and format a 10-digit phone number into `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`.  
   **What I learned:** string cleaning, validation, and producing a standardized output format.

6. 🧾 `coffee_queue.py` — Simple coffee order queue using a menu dictionary and total calculation.  
   **What I learned:** using dictionaries for lookups and accumulating totals for order systems.

7. 🎟️ `raffle_picker.py` — Randomly pick raffle winners from participants and prizes.  
   **What I learned:** random sampling and basic input validation (ensure enough participants).

8. 🛂 `access_scanner.py` — Access control simulator: approve/deny visitors based on badge numbers.  
   **What I learned:** membership checks, collecting approved/denied lists, and defensive input handling.
